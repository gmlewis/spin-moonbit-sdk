WASI filesystem is a filesystem API primarily intended to let users run WASI
programs that access their files on their existing filesystems, without
significant overhead.

It is intended to be roughly portable between Unix-family platforms and
Windows, though it does not hide many of the major differences.

Paths are passed as interface-type `string`s, meaning they must consist of
a sequence of Unicode Scalar Values (USVs). Some filesystems may contain
paths which are not accessible by this API.

The directory separator in WASI is always the forward-slash (`/`).

All paths in WASI are relative paths, and are interpreted relative to a
`descriptor` referring to a base directory. If a `path` argument to any WASI
function starts with `/`, or if any step of resolving a `path`, including
`..` and symbolic link steps, reaches a directory outside of the base
directory, or reaches a symlink to an absolute or rooted path in the
underlying filesystem, the function fails with `error-code::not-permitted`.
