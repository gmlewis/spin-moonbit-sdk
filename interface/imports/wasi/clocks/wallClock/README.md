WASI Wall Clock is a clock API intended to let users query the current
time. The name "wall" makes an analogy to a "clock on the wall", which
is not necessarily monotonic as it may be reset.

It is intended to be portable at least between Unix-family platforms and
Windows.

A wall clock is a clock which measures the date and time according to
some external reference.

External references may be reset, so this clock is not necessarily
monotonic, making it unsuitable for measuring elapsed time.

It is intended for reporting the current date and time for humans.
